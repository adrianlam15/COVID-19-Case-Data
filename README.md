 This program fetches covid-19 data from an API, then extracts the data and outputs it.
 The API used can be found at this [repo](https://github.com/ccodwg/Covid19Canada).
 
**NOTICE:** As of right now, this program is used for extracting CANADIAN COVID-19 cases. UPDATES FOR OTHER COUNTRIES MAY COME IN THE FUTURE!
